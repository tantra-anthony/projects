  storyText: 'You take a massive bite out of the cake. The cake tasted surprisingly
    normal. The thuds grow softer, the screams stop. You notice that the bread on
    the table stopped rotting. The room is unnervingly quiet.


    What is your next step?


    1. Find a way out of the room

    2. Finish the rest of the cake

    3. Pick up the rotten bread'
